      "\t* **Tundras**: Cold and treeless ecosystems found in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.\n",
      "\t* **Forests**: Ecosystems dominated by trees, such as tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests.\n",
      "2. **Freshwater Ecosystems**:\n",
      "\t* **Rivers**: Ecosystems found in flowing water, such as the Amazon River.\n",
      "\t* **Lakes**: Ecosystems found in standing water, such as the Great Lakes.\n",
      "\t* **Wetlands**: Ecosystems found in areas with saturated soil, such as marshes and swamps.\n",
      "3. **Marine Ecosystems**:\n",
      "\t* **Coral Reefs**: Ecosystems found in tropical oceans, characterized by coral formations and diverse marine life.\n",
      "\t* **Estuaries**: Ecosystems found where freshwater rivers meet the ocean, such as the Chesapeake Bay.\n",
      "\t* **Open Ocean**: Ecosystems found in the open sea, characterized by diverse marine life and ocean currents.\n",
      "4. **Atmospheric Ecosystems**:\n",
      "\t* **Atmosphere**: The global ecosystem that surrounds the Earth, including the air and gases that make up the atmosphere.\n",
      "5. **Human-Made Ecosystems**:\n",
      "\t* **Urban Ecosystems**: Ecosystems found in cities and towns, characterized by human activity and infrastructure.\n",
